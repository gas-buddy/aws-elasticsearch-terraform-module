# Terraform Elasticsearch Module for AWS

Use this to set up an Elasticsearch cluster using the AWS provider

## Usage

Note that some of the Terraform config files in here are shipped as ERuby templates rather than .tf files. The files must be rendered before the module can be used. To do so, run:

```
./process_templates.rb
```
